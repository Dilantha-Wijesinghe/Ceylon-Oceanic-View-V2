          <p class="leading-loose font-roboto">Sri Lanka is world-famous for surfing and has breaks suitable for all
            levels, so you'll be in seventh heaven whether you're a hardcore surfer or you've not yet mastered standing
            on a board. The country is a year-round destination because of the seasonal patterns that mean when one
            coast is choppy, the other is calm.
            <span id="dots">...</span>
            <span id="more" class="hidden">
              Koggala Beach
              Intermediate and beginner surfers have plenty of space to practise their moves at this south Sri Lankan
              spot, famous for its fishermen on stilts. The best conditions are in the winter, but continuous breaks are
              not guaranteed at Koggala itself. The nearby Weligama Beach break is also best suited to those just
              starting out; sheltered from oncoming winds, the waves are manageable but can reach up to 1.5m (5ft).
              Midigamaâ€™s waves generate long rides. Ahangama, 20 minutes away, is where the advanced surfers head,
              especially in the peak season (January to February), when the waves can reach 2.5m (8ft).

              Ahangama Beach
              The surfing capital of the Southern Province attracts some serious surfers. With easy access to the waves
              of Weligama, Unawatuna, Mirissa and Midigama, youâ€™ll find numerous surf camps in this small town, where
              the shallow reef also attracts keen snorkellers. Surf straight from the long stretch of beach here, and
              relax under the jungle palms afterwards. The dry season runs from December to March, bringing with it
              offshore winds and good waves. Youâ€™ll still find rideable waves during the wet season, from May to
              September.

              Dewata
              Dewata, south of Galle, has turned into a surfing hotspot over the past five or so years. While not the
              most scenic of local beaches, with small but reliable waves it attracts those looking to perfect their
              technique on year-round easy surf. Right on the beach, the Shack, with its oil-drum beach bar and rooms,
              is the hangout of choice, offering lessons and board rentals. The sand reef and regular (if small- to
              medium-size) waves make it one of the best spots to learn in Sri Lanka, while also providing plenty of fun
              for the adept.


              Arugam Bay Beach
              Arugam Bay is on the east coast, and the best season to be here is when itâ€™s too rainy in the south. The
              weather gods grace Arugam Bay with dry skies while the rest of the island is battered by monsoon rains.
              Itâ€™s best to visit between April and September. Here Baby Point is better for beginners, while Main Point
              is for more advanced riders. Elephant Rock, a tuk-tuk ride from Arugam Bay, is great for beginners, but
              donâ€™t wear flip-flops, as you have to climb rocks to get to it. Itâ€™s worth it because the beach is so
              beautiful. If youâ€™re an experienced surfer, make your way to Pottuvil and Whisky Point, north of Arugam
              Bay. Whisky Point tends to get crowded, so donâ€™t rock up too late in the day.

              Weligama

              Weligama has good waves all year round and is another favourite for beginners and intermediate surfers.
              The main beach has a row of surfing schools with plenty of boards for rent, but it does sometimes suffer
              from pollution. The waves are usually easy to learn on and can get a bit bigger for intermediate level
              surfers. When youâ€™re feeling steady, try Midigama, with three great points. The Lazy Left is better in the
              afternoons and a favourite with goofy riders. The Right has a shallow reef break, while Rams Right is for
              more advanced surfers, with some barrels and short and tight breaks. We also love Gurubebila. Plantation
              Point is great for early morning rides with both lefts and rights. Itâ€™s a rocky entry but is easier to
              ride than Coconut, which is a classic A-Frame formation better tackled by experienced surfers.


              Hikkaduwa

              On the southwest coast of the island, about 120km (75m) south of Colombo and just 20km (12mi) from Galle,
              is the famous party town of Hikkaduwa. Once just a surfing village, itâ€™s now popular with surfers and
              partygoers alike â€“ there is always something happening here. As for the best surf spots, try Bennys, a
              left-hander reef break preferred by experienced surfers. Or thereâ€™s Main Reef, with left- and
              right-handers over a deeper reef, which is good and relatively safe for all levels. We can also recommend
              North Jetty and, for beginners, Beach Break, with its safe shore and reef break.</span>

            are full of incredible sights and wonders just waiting to be explored. We've compiled a list of the best
            sites and the best time of year to visit them.
            <span id="dots">...</span>
            <span id="more" class="hidden">
              NOVEMBER TO MAY
              Kalpitiya
              The Bar Reef, located 2 km off the coast of Kalpitiya, is Sri Lanka's largest coral reef and largest
              protected marine area. The clear water, tremendous variety of tropical fish, and a depth up to 3 meters
              makes it the best location for snorkelling in Kaplitiya. It's also a great site for beginners to learn how
              to dive, as a variety of shallow dives are possible. The reef is home to over 150 species of coral and
              over
              280 species of fish.
              At a depth of 15 meters, the dense fish life and beautiful corals make Bulldog Reef a great place for
              macro
              lovers and underwater photography. Some of the species that can be found here include, crocodile fish,
              moray
              eels and panther turbots.
              The Kalpitiya Ridge spans about 2 km in length and offers dives at a depth of up to 30 meters. In addition
              to exploring underwater caves, divers can also see rock cod, large grouper, humphead wrasse and plenty of
              tropical fish here.
              Other good dive sites in Kalpitiya include Davey's Reef, Trevally Pass and Moray Ridge. The underwater
              currents in Kalpitiya are generally not strong, but they are affected by the changes in tides - two high
              water and two low water. The wind is minimal and water temperatures rarely drop below 23.5 degrees
              Celsius.
              It is advisable to wear a wet suit to protect against bruising from corals.
              Hikkaduwa
              The famous beachside tourist town of Hikkaduwa is considered to be one of the best places for snorkelling
              and scuba diving in the southern coast. It has fully licensed diving centres and PADI instructors, and is
              suitable for both beginners and advanced divers. The coral reefs around Hikkaduwa are among the most
              diverse
              and accessible in the country and are ideal for first-time snorkellers. About 60 species of hard coral and
              170 species of reef fish have been recorded here. Some of the colourful reef fish that can be seen here
              are
              angel fish, butterfly fish, parrot fish and snappers.
              Scuba divers can venture forth into the deeper reefs and rock formations that are abundant with marine
              life.
              Kiralagala, Godagala and Black Coral Point are some of the popular sites for underwater exploration and
              stunning photography.
              Hikkaduwa is also a great location for shipwreck diving. The SS Conch lying off the coast of Akkurala is
              an
              oil tanker which sank in 1903. Apart from the wreck, the site is full of marine life and corals. The
              diving
              depth here is 14.22 meters, and divers can swim into the shipwreck. The four masted iron sail ship, Earl
              of
              Shaftesbury, sank off the coast of Hikkaduwa in 1893. Today, the wreck of the ship lies scattered over the
              sandy terrain at a depth of 15 meters. It is generally inhabited by large stingrays, groupers, snappers,
              lionfish, as well as porcupine fish.
              Unawatuna
              Unawatuna is famous for its sandy beaches as well as for snorkelling and diving. The coral reefs of
              Unawatuna Bay are teeming with colourful marine flora and fauna, just waiting to be explored. The waters
              of
              Unawatuna are perfect for snorkelling, because of its many shallow spots. Another must-visit site is
              Jungle
              Beach, a beautiful beach and a great spot for snorkelling. You will see schools of colourful fish, crabs,
              moray eels, trigger fish, parrot fish and barracudas here.
              The coast of Unawatuna has many fascinating shipwrecks that are great for scuba diving. The SS Rangoon is
              located directly in front of the Galle Fort. It is a British steamer which is believed to have sunk well
              over 100 years ago, and now lies on a sandy plain. Interestingly, the Rangoon rests in an upright sailing
              position, making it a rather interesting site to explore. The wreck is full of marine life including blue
              striped snappers, rabbitfish, red soldierfish and blue fin trevally. Depth is 25-30 meters.
              Weligama
              In addition to its attractive sandy bay, Weligama is an ideal base for snorkelling and diving in the
              south.
              The coral reef here extends a remarkable 700 meters. Besides the colourful corals, you may also see many
              species of fish as well as sea anemones. The site is not very deep, and the seabed is a rather flat area,
              ensuring good visibility. The Yala Rock is a multi-level rocky area in Weligama. Apart from the massive
              rocks, there are also some caves that contain a variety of fish. The dive here generally starts at 15
              meters. The Prince Heinrich Patch is an underwater hill which is great for seeing big rays, parrotfish and
              giant morays. Maximum depth of this dive is 22 meters.
              Colombo
              Colombo has a large number of wrecks ranging from World War I era armed merchant ships to a brand-new ship
              that sank in 2009. Apart from wreck diving, Colombo also has some great reefs to explore.
              Gorgonian Gardens is a seabed filled with majestic Gorgonian fans. At a depth of just over 35 meters, the
              site is a flat seabed covered in varying sizes of fans. Amidst these fans are large numbers of red tooth
              triggerfish. This site is appropriate for experienced divers.
              The Barracuda Reef, located just outside of Colombo in Mount Lavinia, is a long reef that is full of
              marine
              life. You will be able to see snappers, fusiliers, rabbitfish and barracudas here, in addition to a wide
              variety of macro life. The site is between 20-23 meters in depth.
              The SS Worcestershire, an armed British merchant ship, sank in 1917 during the height of the First World
              War. Its wreck is located about 12 km west of Mount Lavinia at
              a depth of 57 meters. Although the shipwreck is largely broken up inside, it maintains its shape on the
              outside. The wreck is packed with marine life, including yellow fin trevally, grey snappers, giant
              trevally
              and groupers. This dive is suitable for advanced divers.
              What is known as the Taprobane North Wreck is actually the British steam ship SS Perseus, which sank in
              1917
              after striking a German sea mine. Located 20 km off the coast of Colombo, the vessel lies at a depth
              between
              30-40 meters. It is covered in soft corals as well as black corals, and is home to fish such as snappers,
              napoleon fish, trevally and grouper. This dive too is suitable for advanced divers.
              MAY TO OCTOBER
              Trincomalee
              Located on the Northeast coast of Sri Lanka, Trincomalee is a popular tourist destination thanks to its
              stunning beaches. Trincomalee has many wrecks as well as reefs that make it a sought after diving
              destination.
              Pigeon Island, a few hundred meters offshore from Nilaveli Beach is a great spot for snorkelling. Diving
              is
              also possible a little further offshore, where the coral reefs have a great display of underwater life.
              The HMS Diomede was a 44-gun fifth rate built during the American Revolutionary Wars. She was deployed in
              a
              squadron to Ceylon to take Trincomalee from the Dutch. However, coming into the bay, she struck a sunken
              rock and sank off the coast of Trincomalee in August 1795. The dive site is silty and visibility is not
              great. Objects found at the site are large cannons and anchors. The site is at a depth of 42 meters.
              There are also a number of Japanese and British aircraft fell into the Trincomalee harbour after a fierce
              air battle that took place in 1942. Some of the aircraft wrecks can be explored by divers.
              Batticaloa
              The famous wreck of the HMS Hermes off the east coast at a depth a little over 50 meters. The Hermes was
              the
              world's first ship to be designed as an aircraft carrier, and it was sunk by Japanese bombers during the
              Second World War. It is considered to be an underwater museum of World War II artefacts. It is also home
              to
              many underwater species such as tuna, grouper, rays, barracudas, snapper and macro critters. The ship sank
              with over 300 of its crew on board, and local divers claim that remains of some crew members can be seen
              upon shining a light through the portholes of the wreck. The wreck lies at a depth between 44-55 meters.
              The Brennus Shoal Wrecks in Batticaloa offer divers two closely located wrecks to explore. The SS Brennus
              sank in 1881, and the SS John Jackson sank in 1908. According to the Maritime Archaeology Unit, the SS
              John
              Jackson is the largest steam shipwreck in the waters of Sri Lanka.
              Great and Little Basses Reefs - Kirinda
              The Great and Little Basses Reefs are located in the Southeast coast of Sri Lanka and are considered to be
              one of the best dive sites in the country. However, the conditions for diving here are only good for a
              short
              period from March to April. Furthermore, as the currents can get very strong, it is recommended that only
              well-experienced divers attempt this dive.
              The Great Basses and Little Basses Reefs are famous for colourful corals, interesting marine life and
              intriguing shipwrecks. Some of the marine life that can be viewed here are tuna, angelfish, spadefish,
              grouper, porpoise, grey sharks, Maori wrasses, snappers and rays.
              The Great Basses reef is also significant for holding the wreck of an 18th century ship belonging to
              India's
              Moghul empire. The wreck was discovered in 1961, by Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Mike Wilson. Some of the most
              intriguing finds from the wreck were fused bags of silver Surat rupees, cannons and cannon balls. The
              40-gun
              frigate, HMS Daedalus, sank in 1813, and its wreck can be explored in Little Basses Reef.
